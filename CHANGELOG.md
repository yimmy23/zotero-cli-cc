# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `zot rename KEY...` renames an item's PDF attachment files from its metadata
  via the bridge plugin. The default template is `{journal}_{year}_{title}`
  (tokens `{journal} {year} {title} {shorttitle} {author}`); `{journal}` is
  resolved from a `Jab/#` tag or an item-type-aware abbreviation (arXiv →
  `Pre`). Non-PDF attachments (Excel/Word/snapshots) are filtered out by
  content type; supplementary PDFs are detected by filename and get an `_SI`
  suffix so names never collide. Supports `--dry-run`, `--main-only`,
  `--force`, `--template`, and `--attachment/--name` for explicit single-file
  renames. Requires the `zot-cli-bridge` plugin **v0.2.0+** (re-run
  `zot bridge install`). `meta.schema_version` is bumped 1.4.0 → 1.5.0.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `zot find-pdf KEY` triggers Zotero desktop's "Find Full Text" over a local
  bridge plugin, so the CLI can fetch and attach PDFs that the Zotero Web API
  cannot reach (paywalled content behind the desktop's configured resolvers,
  authenticated sessions, and institutional proxies). Ships with
  `zot bridge install` / `status` / `uninstall` to package the bundled
  `zot-cli-bridge` plugin into an `.xpi` and guide installation. Both commands
  are also exposed over MCP. `meta.schema_version` is bumped 1.3.0 → 1.4.0 (#43).
- `zot workspace index --skip-tag` excludes attachments carrying a given tag
  from the RAG index (default `skip-index`), so large or irrelevant PDFs can be
  kept out of the index. Also available on the MCP `workspace_index` tool
  (#44, #46).

### Fixed

- On Windows with a CJK (GBK/CP936) system locale, `zot` crashed with
  `UnicodeEncodeError` whenever output contained characters outside the GBK
  range (e.g. emoji). stdout/stderr are now reconfigured to UTF-8 at startup on
  Windows when the encoding is not already UTF-8 (#48).

### Changed

- The bundled Claude Code skill was split from a single `SKILL.md` into a
  concise entry point plus on-demand `references/` files (commands, workspaces,
  workflows, windows-encoding), and now documents the `find-pdf` / `bridge`
  commands and `workspace index --skip-tag` (#49).

## [0.4.4] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- `zot add --doi` created empty items because the Zotero Web API does not
  auto-resolve DOIs the way the desktop translator does. The CLI now
  fetches metadata from Crossref (title, creators, journal, volume/issue/
  pages, date, ISSN, abstract, publisher, language) and merges it into the
  item template before posting, so created items are populated, not bare
  shells. Same fix applies to the MCP `add` / `add_from_pdf` handlers.
  Pass `--no-resolve` to opt out, set `ZOT_CROSSREF_MAILTO` to join
  Crossref's polite pool. `meta.schema_version` is bumped 1.1.0 → 1.2.0
  for the additive envelope slot (`data.resolved` / `data.resolve_warning`)
  (#41, #42).

## [0.4.3] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- Update-available banner hard-coded `uv tool upgrade zotero-cli-cc`, which
  is wrong for users who installed via pip / conda / pipx. The suggested
  command is now detected from `sys.executable` (uv tool / pipx) with a
  `pip install -U` fallback that works for pip, conda, and system installs (#31).

## [0.4.2] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- Update-available nag fired indefinitely after upgrading because
  `__version__` was hardcoded in `__init__.py` and missed in the 0.4.0 / 0.4.1
  bumps, so installed copies of 0.4.1 reported themselves as 0.3.0. Version is
  now sourced from package metadata (`importlib.metadata`), making
  `pyproject.toml` the single source of truth (#30).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-05

Embedding configuration cleanup. The provider-specific Aliyun key
(`aliyun_api_key` / `ZOT_EMBEDDING_ALIYUN_KEY`) and the implicit
`provider="auto"` mode were leaking the multi-provider routing
implementation into the user-facing config without a symmetrical
counterpart for Jina. Single-provider, single-key surface is cleaner.

### Changed

- `[embedding] provider` default is now `"jina"` (was `"auto"`). Set
  `provider = "aliyun"` (or `ZOT_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=aliyun`) to use
  Aliyun DashScope.

### Removed (Breaking, very rare)

- `[embedding] aliyun_api_key` config key — use the unified
  `[embedding] api_key` instead.
- `ZOT_EMBEDDING_ALIYUN_KEY` env var — use `ZOT_EMBEDDING_KEY` instead.
- `provider = "auto"` mode — pick a provider explicitly.

If you upgraded to 0.4.0 within the past hour and were already using
the Aliyun-specific key, rename it to `api_key` /
`ZOT_EMBEDDING_KEY` and set `provider = "aliyun"`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-05

PDF extraction overhaul, envelope routing for the rest of the `--json` surface,
typed exit codes wired up across all command error paths, and a CI repair pass.
`schema_version` bumps to **1.1.0**.

### Added

- **MinerU PDF extractor** alongside the existing pymupdf-based extractor, with
  a new `BasePdfExtractor` abstract class and automatic fallback when MinerU
  fails (`zot pdf KEY --extractor mineru`). Configure via `[pdf] extractor`,
  `[pdf] mineru_token`, or `MINERU_TOKEN` / `ZOT_PDF_EXTRACTOR` env vars.
- **`zot pdf --outline`** — list every heading in the document as a numbered
  outline so agents can navigate without dumping the full text.
- **`zot pdf --section N`** — extract just the content under the N-th heading
  from `--outline`. Useful for "show me the methods section" workflows.
- **`zot workspace index --extractor`** — choose the PDF extractor used during
  RAG indexing.
- **Embedding provider router** with first-class support for Aliyun
  (DashScope, OpenAI-compatible) and Jina endpoints. Routes via the new
  `[embedding] provider` config key / `ZOT_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` env var.
  *(0.4.1 simplified the surface — see below.)*
- **Attachment resolver** that handles `storage:` paths, `file://` URLs,
  Zotero's `attachments:` paths, Windows drive letters, and base-attachment
  prefs. PDFs in non-default storage directories now resolve correctly.
- **`progress_callback`** plumbing through the PDF extraction path so MinerU
  batch operations and per-PDF extraction surface progress to the caller.

### Changed

- **Envelope routing** extended to the remaining `--json` commands:
  `zot pdf` (incl. `--outline` / `--section`), `zot workspace list`,
  `zot workspace query`, and `zot config cache list` now emit the standard
  `{ok, data, meta}` envelope. `workspace query` `data` becomes
  `{mode, results}` rather than the bare results list.
- **`schema_version` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0** to reflect the envelope-coverage extension
  and the typed-exit-code parity. `docs/agent-interface.md` updated.
- **Typed exit codes wired across all command error paths.** Previously many
  error paths called `print_error(...); return`, printing the error message
  but silently exiting 0. They now use `emit_error(...)` with the appropriate
  typed code:
  - `not_found` (4): item / PDF / workspace / collection / profile / index /
    section missing — affects `cite`, `export`, `summarize`, `open`, `pdf`,
    `workspace delete/add/remove/show/export/import/search/index/query`,
    `config profile_set`.
  - `validation_error` (3): bad page range in `pdf`, missing required source
    flag in `workspace import`, invalid workspace name.
  - `auth_missing` (2): all `tag` / `trash restore` / `collection`
    write commands when API credentials aren't configured.
  - `conflict` (6): `workspace new` when the workspace already exists,
    and **`zot duplicates` now exits 6 when duplicates are found** so
    agents can branch on `if zot duplicates …; then …; else act_on_dups; fi`.
  - `runtime_error` (1): caught `PdfExtractionError` in `pdf` and
    `ZoteroWriteError` in `collection move/delete/rename`.
- **`zot relate KEY`** with no related items is now a normal exit-0 outcome
  (matching `zot search` on no matches) rather than an error message.
- **`config cache list`** robustness: graceful fallback when the cache DB is
  unreachable; closes the connection in a `finally` block.

### Fixed

- 20 pre-existing test failures on `main` repaired (some were envelope-shape
  drift between tests and production; the rest were genuine exit-code
  regressions covered by the migration above). The `ci.yml` pytest run goes
  green again.
- `tests/test_extracts_text` no longer breaks on hosts without
  `~/.config/zot/config.toml`. The previous over-broad `Path.exists` mock
  also patched `load_pdf_config`'s file-existence check; tightened to a
  targeted `load_pdf_config` mock.

### Breaking

- Tools / agents parsing `--json` output from `zot pdf`, `zot workspace
  list`, `zot workspace query`, or `zot config cache list` need to unwrap
  the standard envelope (`result["data"]`). Other commands were already
  enveloped; this brings the rest of the surface into line.
- Error paths that previously exited 0 with a printed message now exit
  with their typed code (1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). Scripts that ran
  `zot cite NONEXIST && echo ok` and similar will now correctly fail.
- `zot duplicates` exits **6 (CONFLICT)** when duplicates are detected.
  Scripts that ignored the exit code or used `if zot duplicates; then`
  will need to invert the branch.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-15

Agent-native CLI interface. `zot` now serves humans, AI agents (Claude Code,
Codex), and orchestrators from a single surface. See `docs/agent-interface.md`
for the full contract.

### Added

- **Stable JSON envelope** for every command: `{"ok": true, "data": ..., "meta": {...}}` on success, `{"ok": false, "error": {"code", "message", "retryable"}, "meta": {...}}` on failure, `{"ok": "partial", "data": {"succeeded", "failed"}}` for batch operations.
- **TTY auto-detection**: `--json` is now implicit when stdout is not a TTY. Agents piping `zot` output always get parseable JSON without remembering a flag. Override with `ZOT_FORMAT=json|table|text`.
- **Typed exit codes**: 0 success, 1 runtime error, 2 auth error, 3 validation error, 4 not-found, 5 network error, 6 conflict. Orchestrators can route failures deterministically.
- `zot schema [command...]` — machine-readable introspection for the full CLI tree. Each entry carries `name`, `params` (typed), `safety_tier`, `since`, `deprecated`, and nested `subcommands`. Agents can discover every command without a README.
- **Safety tiers in `--help`**: top-level help groups commands into Read / Write (MUTATES LIBRARY) / Destructive sections. Destructive command help carries a "MUTATES LIBRARY" warning.
- **`--dry-run`** on all mutating commands: `add`, `update`, `note --add`, `attach`, `delete`, `trash restore`. Preview shape: `{"ok": true, "dry_run": true, "data": {"would": ...}}`.
- **`--idempotency-key`** on `add`, `update`, `note --add`, `attach`, `delete`. SQLite-backed cache at `$ZOT_CACHE_DIR/idempotency.db` (default `~/.cache/zotero-cli-cc`) with 24h TTL. Retried calls carrying the same key return the original envelope and never duplicate the upstream mutation.
- **`meta` slot** on every envelope: `request_id` (uuid), `latency_ms`, `schema_version`, `cli_version`. Mutating commands also set `sync_required: true`.
- **`next` hints** in success envelopes: `add`, `update`, `delete`, `note --add`, `attach` suggest plausible follow-up commands so the agent saves a planning turn.
- **`retryable` field on every error**: network / 5xx / rate-limit → `retryable: true`; not-found / validation / 4xx → `retryable: false`. `ZoteroWriteError` carries `code`, `retryable`, `retry_after_seconds`.
- **`--stream` mode** on `search`, `list`, `recent` — emits NDJSON (one item per line) plus a summary line. Agents can process long result sets incrementally.
- **Structured stderr progress events** for long-running commands (`add --from-file`, `summarize-all`): NDJSON `{event, phase, done, total, elapsed_ms, request_id}` so agents can detect liveness without blocking on the final stdout envelope.
- **Confirmation-required guard** on destructive commands: `zot delete K1` with non-interactive stdin and no `--yes`/`--dry-run` returns a structured `confirmation_required` error instead of blocking.
- New `exit_codes.py`, `core/idempotency.py` modules.
- 43 new tests across `test_agent_interface.py`, `test_agent_p1.py`, `test_agent_p2.py`.

### Changed

- `format_error` / `format_items` / `format_item_detail` / `format_collections` / `format_notes` / `format_duplicates` now wrap JSON output in the envelope. Callers that parsed raw arrays must unwrap via `env["data"]`.
- Human error messages moved from stdout to stderr via the new `print_error` helper.
- `ErrorInfo` dataclass gains `code` and `retryable` fields.
- Top-level CLI group uses a custom `TieredGroup` help renderer.

### Breaking

- JSON output contract: callers parsing bare arrays or dicts must now read from `env["data"]`. Error responses now nest under `env["error"]` with `code` / `message` / `retryable` fields instead of a flat `{"error": "..."}`.
- Exit codes: previously `1` for all failures; now distinct codes per failure class. Scripts checking for any non-zero exit remain valid.
